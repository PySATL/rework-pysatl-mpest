"""Provides a configurable, iterative estimator for mixture models.

This module defines the `Pipeline` class, which orchestrates an iterative
estimation process by executing a sequence of processing steps. It allows for
the flexible construction of algorithms like Expectation-Maximization (EM) by
combining different steps (:class:`PipelineStep`), stopping criteria (:class:`Breakpointer`),
and component pruning strategies (:class:`Pruner`).

class Pipeline(BaseEstimator):
    """An estimator that fits a mixture model via a configurable iterative process.

    The pipeline executes a sequence of defined steps in a loop. After each full
    sequence of steps, pruning strategies are applied, and stopping conditions
    are checked. The loop continues until a breakpointer signals to stop.
    This allows for building complex, multi-stage estimation algorithms,
    such as variants of the EM algorithm.

    The core components used for configuration are:

    - :class:`.PipelineStep`
    - :class:`Breakpointer`
    - :class:`Pruner`

    Parameters
    ----------
    steps : Sequence[PipelineStep]
        An ordered sequence of steps to be executed in each iteration of the
        pipeline.
    breakpointers : Sequence[Breakpointer]
        A sequence of strategies that define the stopping conditions for the
        iterative process. This list cannot be empty.
    pruners : Sequence[Pruner] | None, optional
        A sequence of strategies for removing components from the mixture model
        during fitting. Defaults to None, meaning no pruning is performed.
    once_in_iterations: int, optional
        The logging frequency. A value of `n` means logging occurs every
        `n` iterations. Defaults to 1 (log every iteration).

    Attributes
    ----------
    steps : list[PipelineStep]
        The ordered list of operations to be performed in each iteration.
    breakpointers : list[Breakpointer]
        The list of objects that determine when the fitting process should
        terminate.
    pruners : list[Pruner]
        The list of objects that may remove components from the mixture during
        the fitting process.
    logger : PipelineLogger
        object that collects comprehensive information about each
        iteration of a :class:`Pipeline` estimator.
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the sequence of :attr:`steps` is empty or invalid (i.e., a step is
        followed by a step not listed in its :attr:`available_next_steps`), or if
        the sequence of :attr:`breakpointers` is empty.

    Attributes
    ----------
    iteration : int
        The iteration number (0-based index).
    mixture : MixtureModel
        The state of the mixture model after pruning in this iteration.
    X : NDArray[float64]
        The input data sample being processed (conventionally named `X`).
    H : Optional[NDArray[float64]]
        The responsibility matrix (posterior probabilities) if available,

        Any exception that occurred during the iteration, or `None` if

class IterationsHistory:
    """A container for storing and accessing pipeline iteration history.

    `IterationsHistory` collects and stores snapshots of each pipeline iteration
    (as `IterationRecord` objects) according to a configurable frequency.
    It is a structured history buffer for programmatic analysis.

    This class supports sequence-like access via indexing (e.g., `history[0]`)
    and length queries (`len(history)`), making it easy to inspect specific
    iterations or iterate over recorded states.

    .. note::
    The *i*-th entry in this container (i.e., `history[i]`) corresponds to
    the pipeline iteration number `i * once_in_iterations`. For example,
    if `once_in_iterations=5`, then `history[0]` holds iteration 0,
    `history[1]` holds iteration 5, `history[2]` holds iteration 10, and so on.

    Example usage:

    >>> history = IterationsHistory(once_in_iterations=2)
    >>> # Inside pipeline loop:
    >>> record = IterationRecord(iteration=0, mixture=..., X=X, H=H, ...)
    >>> history.log(record)
    >>> # Later:
    >>> print(len(history))  # number of stored records
    >>> first = history[0]  # access first logged iteration

    Parameters
    ----------
    once_in_iterations : int, optional
        The recording frequency. A value of `n` means a record is stored every
        `n` iterations (e.g., `n=3` stores iterations 0, 3, 6, ...).
        Defaults to 1 (record every iteration).

    Attributes
    ----------
    once_in_iterations : int
        The configured recording frequency.
    _counter : int
        Internal counter tracking the total number of `log()` calls
        (i.e., total iterations processed, not just recorded ones).
    _logs : list[IterationRecord]
        List of stored iteration records. Only iterations matching the
        recording frequency are appended.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `once_in_iterations` is not a positive integer.

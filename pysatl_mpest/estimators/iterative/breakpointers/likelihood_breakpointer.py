class LikelihoodBreakpointer(Breakpointer):
    """Stops the pipeline when the log-likelihood of the mixture converges.

    This breakpointer terminates the iterative estimation process when the
    absolute difference between the current and previous log-likelihood values
    falls below a specified threshold:

    .. math::
        |L_{t+1} - L_t| < threshold

    Only observations whose mixture log-density is not ``-inf`` contribute to
    the sum. Consecutive sums are compared only when the same observations
    contribute; a changed support mask establishes a new comparison baseline.
    Thus, this sum can be finite even when ``mixture.loglikelihood(X)`` is
    ``-inf`` because that method includes observations outside the support.

    An empty support or a non-finite sum emits a ``RuntimeWarning`` and stops
    the pipeline. Both the stored sum and support mask are reset whenever this
    breakpointer stops the pipeline, including ordinary convergence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : Scalar
        The convergence threshold for the log-likelihood difference.
        Must be a positive number.

    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold : Scalar
        The convergence threshold.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `threshold` is not greater than 0.

        Exclude only log-densities equal to ``-inf`` and compare sums only
        when their observation masks match. Unlike ``loglikelihood(X)``, this
        sum omits observations outside the mixture support. A changed mask
        replaces the stored sum and mask without declaring convergence.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : PipelineState
            The current state of the pipeline, which must contain a valid
            `curr_mixture` and data `X`.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True when comparable sums differ by less than ``threshold``, or
            when the sum is non-finite or has no contributing observations.
            Both stored values are reset on True. The first call and any
            change of support return False and establish a new baseline.

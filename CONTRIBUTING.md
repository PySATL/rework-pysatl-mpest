# Pysatl-mpest project contributing guide

Thank you very much if you have decided to contribute to our project.

## How to Contribute to pysatl-mpest

Follow these steps to get started. We use the Forking Workflow model.

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, you need to fork (create a copy of) the main repository.

1. Navigate to the repository page: https://github.com/PySATL/pysatl-mpest
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.



### 2. Clone the Fork and Create a Branch

Now that you have a fork, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pysatl-mpest.git
cd pysatl-mpest
```

Before you start making changes, create a new branch in following format `<your-username>/<what-this-branch-solves>` if this branch on the original repository. If you working in the fork, name your branches at your own discretion.

For example: `iraedeus/add-new-solver` or `vityana/memory-leak-issue`.

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b <your-username>/<what-this-branch-solves>
```



### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

To start working on the code, you need to install the project dependencies and set up the pre-commit hooks. These hooks automatically check your code for quality and style before each commit.

1. **Install dependencies:**

   Follow steps in [README.md](README.md)

2. **Install pre-commit hooks (Mandatory):**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

   This command sets up the hooks in your local Git repository. **This is a required step for all contributors.**

Now your environment is ready. The hooks will run automatically every time you run `git commit`.



### 4. Make and Commit Changes

Work on the code in your new branch. When you're ready to save your changes, create a commit. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to standardize commit messages.

Use the following types:

- `feat`: to add new functionality.
- `fix`: to fix a bug in the project.
- `refactor`: for code refactoring, such as renaming a variable or improving readability.
- `test`: to add or refactor tests.
- `struct`: for changes related to the project structure (NOT CODE), for example, changing folder locations.
- `ci`: for various CI/CD tasks.
- `docs`: for changes in documentation.
- `chore`: for other changes that do not affect the code or tests (e.g., updating `.gitignore`, `README.md`).



```bash
# Add the files you have changed
git add .

# Create a commit with a proper message
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user authentication"
```

Try to divide commits into atomic and independent parts. That is, do not add unrelated changes to the code in one commit.



### 5. Push Changes to Your Fork

After you have made one or more commits, push your branch to your remote fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push
```



### 6. Documentation requirements

High-quality documentation is crucial for the project's maintainability and  usability. All contributions that add or modify code **must** include corresponding documentation updates.

#### File Header and Module Docstring

Every Python source file (`.py`) must begin with a standard header containing metadata and a module-level docstring. This ensures consistency and proper attribution.

**Template:**

```python
"""Module docstring"""

__author__ = "Your Name"
__copyright__ = "Copyright (c) 2025 PySATL project"
__license__ = "SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT"

# ... rest of the module code
```

#### Docstring Style and Content

We use the **NumPy docstring standard** as our base format. All public modules, classes, methods, and functions must have comprehensive docstrings that are compatible with **Sphinx** for automatic documentation generation.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Use Sphinx Roles for Cross-Referencing:**
   To ensure that our documentation is fully navigable, all references to  other code elements (classes, methods, attributes, parameters) within  docstrings **must** use Sphinx roles. This turns them into clickable hyperlinks in the generated documentation.
   - Use ``:class:`ClassName``` to reference a class.
   - Use ``:meth:`method_name``` to reference a method.
   - Use ``:attr:`attribute_name``` to reference an attribute or property.
   - Use ``:func:`function_name``` to reference a function.
   - To shorten a long path, use a tilde (~). For example, ``:class:~rework_pysatl_mpest.core.mixture.MixtureModel``` will be rendered simply as MixtureModel`.
2. **Include autosummary for Public APIs:**
   For classes, the docstring should include an `.. autosummary::` block. This directive instructs Sphinx to automatically generate a summary table of the class's public methods and attributes.
   - List all public methods that should be included in the documentation.
   - Use the `:toctree: generated/` option.
3. **Structure and Detail:**
   - **Classes:** The docstring should clearly describe the class's purpose, followed by Parameters (for the constructor), Attributes, Methods (via autosummary), and Notes or Examples where applicable.
   - **Methods/Functions:** Must include a description, Parameters with types, Returns with type, and Raises for any exceptions thrown.

#### Building and Previewing Documentation Locally

Our documentation is built using **Sphinx**. Before submitting your pull request, you **must** generate the documentation locally to ensure there are no formatting errors, warnings, or broken links.

1. Navigate to the `docs` directory:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. Build the documentation:

   ```bash
   make clean html
   ```

3. Preview the result:

   The output will be generated in the `docs/build/html` directory. Open `docs/build/html/index.html` in your web browser to review the changes and verify that everything renders correctly.

#### Updating Architectural Documentation

If your changes introduce significant architectural modifications (e.g., adding a new major component, changing the core data flow, or altering the relationship between modules), you must also update the design documentation. This includes updating both the descriptive text and any relevant diagrams (e.g., UML, flowcharts).



### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once your branch with the changes is in your fork, you can create a Pull Request to propose your changes to the main repository.

1. Go to your fork's page on GitHub (https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pysatl-mpest).
2. You will see a notification prompting you to create a Pull Request for your recently pushed branch. Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
3. Ensure the base repository is `PySATL/pysatl-mpest` with the main branch, and the head repository is your fork and your working branch.
4. Give your Pull Request a meaningful title (following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.conventionalcommits.org%2F) standard) and add a detailed description of the changes you've made.

#### Rules for Your PR to be Merged

For your Pull Request to be merged, it must meet the following requirements configured in the repository:

- **CI/CD Checks Must Pass:** All automated status checks (tests, linters, etc.) configured in the project must complete successfully. If any check fails, you will need to fix the issue and push new commits to your branch.
- **Mandatory Code Review:**
  - Your PR must receive at least **one approval** from another project member.
  - The PR author **cannot** approve their own work. The most recent set of changes must be approved by someone other than the person who pushed them.
  - If you push new commits to your branch after receiving an approval, that approval will be automatically dismissed. The changes will need to be reviewed again. This ensures that the latest version of the code is always reviewed.
- **All Conversations Must Be Resolved:** All comments and conversations on the code left during the review must be marked as resolved before the PR can be merged.
- **No Force Pushing:** The main branch is protected from force pushes to ensure a stable and clean commit history.

Each pull request must be reviewed by one of the maintainers:

* Danil Totmyanin ([iraedeus](https://github.com/iraedeus))
